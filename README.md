# Introduction to Digital Humanities — Individual Project
## Analysis of British Drama Metadata (1540–1926)
**Xinran Liu (r1069247)**

## 1. About the Project
This repository contains the individual analysis component of the *Introduction to Digital Humanities* course (KU Leuven). It follows a group project in which the raw British drama metadata was cleaned using **OpenRefine**.

In this individual project, I further processed the cleaned dataset in **Python** to:
- describe publication trends over time,
- examine authorship patterns, and
- explore socio-cultural signals reflected in the evolution of keywords in drama titles.

### Repository contents
- `data/`: cleaned British Drama Metadata (1540–1926) from the group project (OpenRefine output)
- `data_wrangled/`: derived datasets used in analysis
- `Codes and tools`: Python code for cleaning, analysis, and feature extraction
- `outputs/`: charts, tables, and exported figures
- `project management/`: project management plan and additional documentation

## 2. Research Questions
1. How do **geographical terms** in British drama titles change from the mid-16th century to the early 20th century?
2. Do title keywords suggest a shift in dominant themes (e.g., from **aristocratic** to more **domestic** topics) over time?

## 3. Tools & Packages Used
- **Python** (data wrangling and analysis)
- **Tableau** (visualization)
- **GitHub** (version control)

 Key Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn, regex.

## 4. Acknowledgements
AI tools were used to support parts of the workflow (e.g., code troubleshooting and language polishing).
