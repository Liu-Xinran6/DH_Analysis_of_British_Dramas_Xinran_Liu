### 1 About the Project
This is the second part, i.e. personal analysis part, of the data analysis and project management assignment of the course Introduction to Digital Humanities, KU Leuven, following the group project in which the raw data of British Drama Metadata was cleaned with OpenRefine. In this part, I further processed the data with Python, made descriptive analysis of the number of publications, authorship, publication patterns over time, and explored the socio-cultural features mirrored by the evolution of keywords in the dramatic titles.
This repository includes:
- data (cleaned with OpenRefine): British Drama Metadata (1540-1926), including Comedy, Tragedy and Play
- Wrangled Data for Analysis
- Project Management Plan
- Codes and Tools
- Charts and Tables Generated

### 2 Research Questions
-Is there an evolution of Geographical Terms in the British Drama Titles from mid-16th Century to early 20th Century
-Do title keywords indicate a shift from aristocratic to domestic themes over time?
### 3 Tools & Packages Used
**Software:**  
Python for further analysis, Tableau for visualization and GitHub for version control.

### 4 Acknowledgements 
-AI tools have been used for extracting geographical terms and keywords in the aristocratic/private domain
